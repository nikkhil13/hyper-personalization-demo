# Credit Card Hyperpersonalization

This is the Gitlab page for the hyperpersonalization demo build by SAS India Platform Team.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The context to this use case stems from a discussion we had with some of our customers on wanting to get to the next level of Customer Interaction or Personalization.

So, the idea in terms of building this work product was to demonstrate

* How itâ€™s different
* Repeatable - While the demo theme is related with Credit Card as banking product, keep the design principles flexible so that we can replicate it for some other product
